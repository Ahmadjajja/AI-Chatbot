# React Countdown Timer Assignment

## Objective
In this assignment, you will create a countdown timer using React.js. The goal is to practice and understand the concepts of `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.

## Features to Implement

### 1. Timer Setup:
- Create a countdown timer that starts from a user-defined number of seconds (e.g., 60 seconds).
- Use the `useState` hook to manage the current countdown value.

### 2. Start Countdown:
- When a "Start" button is clicked, the timer should start counting down every second.
- Use the `useEffect` hook to handle the side effect of setting up and updating the timer.

### 3. Stop Timer:
- Add a "Stop" button that will halt the countdown at any point.

### 4. Reset Timer:
- Implement a "Reset" button that resets the timer to its initial value entered by the user.

### 5. Timer End:
- When the timer reaches zero, it should stop automatically and display an alert notifying the user that the time is up.

## Concepts Covered
- **useState**: Managing the countdown value and resetting the timer.
- **useEffect**: Starting the timer and cleaning up the interval when necessary.

## Bonus (Optional)
- Add an input field where users can specify how many seconds the countdown should start from.
- Style the app using basic CSS for a better user experience.

## Example Flow:
1. User enters the initial countdown time.
2. The user clicks "Start," and the timer begins counting down.
3. The user can stop the timer using the "Stop" button.
4. The timer can be reset using the "Reset" button to its original value.
5. When the timer hits zero, an alert is triggered.
